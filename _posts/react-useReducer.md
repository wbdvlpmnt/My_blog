excerpt: "React's useReducer hook was a game changer for me. The small time investment in learning about the useReducer hook paid off, as it centralizes state and state logic in more complex applications. It reduces complex prop drilling as the state is centralized."

React's useReducer hook is much like the javascript array reducer. It allows us to specify a reducer function, which takes in state and an action. The action can be triggered to perform state updates.

Since the state lives in one, centralized location; state updates can be easily made by simply using the dispatch function to trigger a new action. This eliminates the need to pass complex state around your application. It also makes components simpler, and therefore simpler to test.

I really enjoyed learning about the useReducer hook, and look forward to using this feature in future development.
