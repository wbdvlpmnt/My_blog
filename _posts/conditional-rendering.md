title: "Conditional Rendering"
excerpt: "Conditional rendering is the act of displaying a UI component based on state. Think of a Log In component which welcomes the user by name or prompts the user to log in. Conditional rendering is important to create reactive application with great UI/UX. Here are some techniques you can adopt in your next application"

Conditional rendering allows us to make reactive applications that are dynamic and change with user interactions. Conditional rendering is often time based on state, sometimes on calculated/derived state. There are several forms of conditional rendering that you can use:

1. Nullish Coalescing Operator:
   This is the ?? operator that allows us to return the right hand side operand when the left hand side is null or undefined. [check it out](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing)

2. Ternary Operator:
   This is a the classic conditional rendering ooperator that mimicas an if statement. It uses the ?: syntax, where we have a condition before the ? which if evaluates to true then the true logic is execute (before the :) and conversely if false the false logic is executed.

3. Logical && Operator:
   The logical && operator, allows you to execute the right hand side of the expression if the left hand side is true. [check it out](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND)
