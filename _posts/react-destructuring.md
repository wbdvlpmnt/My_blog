There are several types of destructuring we can perform in JavaScript. We can destructure objects and even arrays.

Destructuring means that we can pull out values of interest from an object or array. There are some more advanced destructuring use cases such as nested destructuring, renaming variables,and destructuing function parameters (this is how we destructure props in React).

Destructuring is not necessary for code to work, but it definitely makes code more readable and easier to understand. It is a cleaner way of doing things. Try it in your next project or feature and see if it works for you as well!
