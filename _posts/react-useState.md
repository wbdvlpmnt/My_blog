title: "The React useState Hook"
excerpt: "The useState hook in React is used in functional components to manage state. It takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array with the current state and a function to update it. This allows functional components to keep track of and update their state, making them more dynamic and interactive."

The useState is a hook that allows functional components to manage state. Before the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, state management was primarily handled in class components using the setState method. With the useState hook, functional components can now manage local state in a more concise and expressive manner.

The useState hook can be used multiple times in a single component to manage different pieces of state. Each call to useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

Keep in mind that when using useState, React preserves the state between renders, which means that the state variable retains its value even if the component re-renders due to other reasons. This behavior ensures that the state is not lost between renders.
